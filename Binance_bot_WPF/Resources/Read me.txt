Hello!

Thank you for using our automated trading application. We are sure that this will greatly facilitate your life. 
So, in order to run the bot, you need to open the file with the .exe extension, 
in the window that appears, enter the necessary data, such as:
1) The name of the coins you will trade.
2) The number of coins that will be placed in orders.
3) The number of decimal places for rounding the amount (we advise you to put the maximum possible number)
4) Your API Key.
5) Your Secret API Key.

To start the bot, click the "Start" button. 
If everything works successfully, the background of the application will change to the face of a cute cat :)

To pause, click Stop. 
If it necessary to continue the program, click again on the "Start" button.

To exit the application, click "Exit".
